 * \brief	Macro implementation for double-linked lists. The names for
 * 			the next and prev link elements have to be specified as
 * 			parameter.
 *
 * This version of the list macros uses the head element as functional
 * part of the list, i.e. it also stores data. Therefor, the list head
 * is required to be a pointer. head->prev points to the last element
 * of the list, while the list is delimited by 0x0 with
 * head->prev->next = 0x0
