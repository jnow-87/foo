\chapter{Introduction}
\brickos is operating system kernel targeted to multiple diverse host platforms. It shall provide a common hardware abstraction through the system library.

The project contains the following main components
\begin{description}
	\item[Kernel] The kernel provides interfaces for basic process and thread scheduling, event handling as well as inter-thread communication, cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:arch}.
	\item[Architecture Abstraction Layer] The architecture abstraction is the main interface to specific target hardware that is required by kernel and system library, cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:kernel}.
	\item[Driver] Device drivers exposes interfaces to specific target hardware, that is not required by kernel or system library, cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:driver}.
	\item[System Library] The system library implements the interface between the kernel and user applications and thus is required to be linked against each application.
	\item[Common Functions] Functions that are required by kernel, system library as well as user functions are grouped and linked against kernel as well as user applications.
\end{description}

\section{Style Guidelines}
\subsection{Pointer Syntax}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \lstinline{'*'} belongs to the name\\
			\lstinline{int *p;}

		\item function pointers with pointer return types shall have the \lstinline{'*'} of the return type surrounded by spaces\\
		  	\lstinline{int * (*fct)(void);}

		\item \lstinline{const} shall be placed right of the type\\
			\lstinline{int const i;}
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \lstinline{/* macros */}
		\item \lstinline{/* types */}
		\item \lstinline{/* prototypes */}
		\item \lstinline{/* local/static prototypes */}
		\item \lstinline{/* external variables */}
		\item \lstinline{/* global variables */}
		\item \lstinline{/* static variables */}
		\item \lstinline{/* global functions */}
		\item \lstinline{/* local functions */}
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Prototypes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \lstinline{static} shall be used for prototype and function definition
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Macros}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item use \lstinlne{#ifdef <var>} over \lstinline{#if <var> == <value>}
		\item use \lstinline{#if defined(<var>)} for more complex pre-processor checkds
	\end{itemize}
